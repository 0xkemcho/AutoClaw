FX markets move twenty-four hours a day, across every timezone on earth.

Most traders are asleep for eight of them.

Positions go unmanaged. Signals get missed. Yield sits idle.

...

Meet AutoClaw.

An autonomous agent platform on the Celo blockchain — built to work while you don't.

...

Getting started takes seconds.

Connect your wallet — or sign in with Google, Apple, or X. No KYC, no forms, no friction.

You land straight on your overview. Pick an agent, configure your guardrails — maximum trade size, daily limits, the currencies you want — and activate it.

That's it. Your agent is live.

...

The FX Trading Agent monitors live news and macro signals with AI.

It reads the headlines, generates a signal — buy, sell, or hold — checks it against your rules, and executes a stablecoin swap on Mento Protocol.

Gasless. Non-custodial. On Celo mainnet.

You can watch every step happen in real time.

...

The Yield Agent works in parallel.

It scans ICHI vaults, Uniswap, and Merkl for the best on-chain returns — deploys your idle stablecoins, claims rewards, and auto-compounds — continuously.

No manual intervention. No missed opportunities.

...

And when you want to understand what's happening — just ask.

AutoClaw's intelligence agent has access to live prices, FX news, social sentiment from X, and Celo governance data.

Ask it why your agent sold EURm. Ask it where yield on Celo is right now.

It knows.

...

Every trade logged on-chain. Every decision auditable.

And every AutoClaw agent is registered on-chain via ERC-8004 — a verifiable identity, a transparent track record. Not a black box.

Your agents run whether you're watching or not.

...

AutoClaw is live on Celo mainnet.

Connect your wallet and deploy your first agent at autoclaw.co.

## ELEVENLABS TIPS

- Generate 3–4 takes. The first is rarely the best.
- If "AutoClaw" sounds off, add it to your pronunciation dictionary as: **"Auto-Claw"**
- If "Mento" sounds rushed, write it as: **"Mento Protocol"** (the extra word forces a natural pause)
- If "EURm" sounds wrong, write phonetically: **"Euro-M"**
- The `...` lines create deliberate pauses between sections — keep them in when pasting
- Export as WAV 44.1kHz for best quality before importing to your video editor
